                    A video showing Assassins of Kings was leaked on 16 September 2009, before the game was officially announced. 
                    According to CD PROJEKT RED, the video was intended for potential publishers, and had been created about six 
                    months before it was leaked. It was made using a "very early alpha version" of the game, and voices were provided 
                    by CD PROJEKT RED staff members rather than the final actors. CD PROJEKT RED published a short FAQ in response 
                    to the leak, but said that apart from that, they did "not plan any materials to be released soon". The game itself 
                    was said to be "still deeply in the development stage", and people should "not expect the game too soon".
                </p>
                <p>
                    The game was announced officially on 24 March 2010, with a number of articles and videos appearing. A two-minute 
                    trailer was released on GameTrailers, and articles (with accompanying video and screenshots) have been released 
                    in English, Polish, and Russian.

                <hr>
                <p>
                    The plot of The Witcher 2 is intended to be less linear than that of the first game, and is supposed to feature 
                    "three independent plot lines" which lead to multiple endings.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Witcher 2 is set almost immediately after the first, and follows from the attempt on King Foltest's life which 
                    occurred in the final cutscene.[1] Geralt will once again face the mysterious witcher-like assassins, who appear to 
                    be connected with a character named in previews as the Kingslayer.[2] In a trailer, the Kingslayer is seen speaking 
                    to Iorveth, a human-hating elf. The Kingslayer displays a head which he claims belonged to King Demavend of Aedirn, 
                    and says that if Iorveth is prepared to help, more kings will also fall.
                </p>
                <p>
                    ther plot elements which have been referenced (but which do not necessarily correspond to the three plot lines mentioned) 
                    are Foltest's moves to capture the stronghold of the rebellious Baroness La Valette and "Geralt's personal theme, 
                    in which he's looking for his own identity"
                </p>
                <p>
                    According to a fact sheet released for the game, Geralt's travels "will lead him up the river Pontar into the turbulent 
                    borderland between Temeria, Kaedwen and Aedirn".[1] A town named Flotsam, situated on the border between Temeria and Aedirn, 
                    will feature. <br>
                    Characters returning from the first game include Triss Merigold, Zoltan, and Dandelion. A new character to be introduced 
                    is Vernon Roche, a member of the Temerian military who has been sent to help Geralt
                </p>
                <p>
                    The narrative takes Geralt from Foltest's side, through an assault on La Valette Castle, then through Flotsam, Aedirn 
                    (either the dwarven town of Vergen or a Kaedweni camp depending on his alliances) and finally to Loc Muinne where he 
                    has a final face off with a dragon.

                <ul>
                    <li>The game features a few timed conversations, with a default response being used if players do not choose an option 
                        within a certain length of time. Players are not presented with the full, exact line that Geralt will deliver, instead 
                        choosing from among short summaries.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The combat system has been reworked, being "much more open-ended" and which "no longer requires the timed input 
                        of the original game".
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The "romance cards" are not returning, although Geralt still has opportunities for encounters. These are now handled with cutscenes.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        According to a Polish preview, it is possible to import a saved game from The Witcher.

                    <li>
                        Fighting alongside companions has received greater emphasis, although they still act autonomously rather than being under the control of the player. 
                        How players relate to these companions (both in conversations and elsewhere) can open up quests and affect the game's ending.

                    <li>
                        Meditation can now be done anywhere, provided there are no enemies nearby to prevent it, but Geralt must now enter meditation mode to drink a potion.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Geralt can now climb over walls and other such obstacles.
