                <h1>The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt</h1>
                <p>
                    The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt is the third installment in the series of games developed by CD PROJEKT RED featuring 
                    the witcher Geralt of Rivia. The game was originally scheduled for release in late 2014, then pushed back to 
                    24 February 2015, and finally released on 19 May 2015. During the first two weeks since release it had 
                    sold more than 4 million copies worldwide, more than doubling the total sales of its predecessor, 
                    The Witcher 2: Assassins of Kings.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Unlike the previous games, The Witcher 3 is set in a multi-region open world, featuring over 100 hours of content. 
                    Several early articles mentioned that the developers planned to have an open world similar to that of Skyrim, but 
                    20% larger. The developers were quick to point out that while there was much to appreciate in Bethesda's open world 
                    concept, they were also making an effort not to repeat what they perceived as the flaws in-game. As with earlier 
                    games, the consequences of Geralt's actions will impact how the narrative progresses. The game has been built using 
                    the new REDengine 3 and was designed with player feedback from fans of previous Witcher games in mind. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    On September 4, 2020, it was announced that the game and its expansions would be getting a next-generation upgrade 
                    and would be released as a standalone purchase for the next-generation consoles (Xbox Series X and PlayStation 5) 
                    as well as PC. A free update will be given out to those who already own the game on the PC, Xbox One, and PlayStation 4.
                    While it was originally expected to be released in 2021 it was later announced that the next-generation update had been 
                    delayed to 2022 before CDPR announced it'd be released on December 14, 2022.

                    The world is in chaos. The air is thick with tension and the smoke of burnt villages. The fearsome Empire of 
                    Nilfgaard has struck again, ravaging the helpless Northern Kingdoms. The once mighty who tried to use Geralt 
                    for their own gain are now gone. In these uncertain times, no one can say what fortune holds in store, who 
                    will bring peace to the world and who will cause it only misery. But a force darker and deadlier emerges.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The petty men and women commanding tin-plated armies fail to understand that their conflict is child's play 
                    compared to the Wild Hunt, the otherworldly threat which now looms. These ghastly spectral riders have for 
                    ages plagued humankind, bringing misery to the world. This time the Wild Hunt seeks one person in particular: 
                    the one individual Destiny itself bestowed upon Geralt, the one soul Geralt considers kin.

                <h2>Story</h2>
                <hr>
                <p>
                    The plot of The Witcher 2 is intended to be less linear than that of the first game, and is supposed to feature 
                    "three independent plot lines" which lead to multiple endings.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Witcher 2 is set almost immediately after the first, and follows from the attempt on King Foltest's life which 
                    occurred in the final cutscene. Geralt will once again face the mysterious witcher-like assassins, who appear to 
                    be connected with a character named in previews as the Kingslayer. In a trailer, the Kingslayer is seen speaking 
                    to Iorveth, a human-hating elf. The Kingslayer displays a head which he claims belonged to King Demavend of Aedirn, 
                    and says that if Iorveth is prepared to help, more kings will also fall.
                </p>
                <p>
                    ther plot elements which have been referenced (but which do not necessarily correspond to the three plot lines mentioned) 
                    are Foltest's moves to capture the stronghold of the rebellious Baroness La Valette and "Geralt's personal theme, 
                    in which he's looking for his own identity"
                </p>
                <p>
                    According to a fact sheet released for the game, Geralt's travels "will lead him up the river Pontar into the turbulent 
                    borderland between Temeria, Kaedwen and Aedirn". A town named Flotsam, situated on the border between Temeria and Aedirn, 
                    will feature. <br>
                    Characters returning from the first game include Triss Merigold, Zoltan, and Dandelion. A new character to be introduced 
                    is Vernon Roche, a member of the Temerian military who has been sent to help Geralt
                </p>
                <p>
                    The narrative takes Geralt from Foltest's side, through an assault on La Valette Castle, then through Flotsam, Aedirn 
                    (either the dwarven town of Vergen or a Kaedweni camp depending on his alliances) and finally to Loc Muinne where he 
                    has a final face off with a dragon.

                <ul>
                    <li>The game features a few timed conversations, with a default response being used if players do not choose an option 
                        within a certain length of time. Players are not presented with the full, exact line that Geralt will deliver, instead 
                        choosing from among short summaries.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The combat system has been reworked, being "much more open-ended" and which "no longer requires the timed input 
                        of the original game".
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The "romance cards" are not returning, although Geralt still has opportunities for encounters. These are now handled with cutscenes.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        According to a Polish preview, it is possible to import a saved game from The Witcher.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Fighting alongside companions has received greater emphasis, although they still act autonomously rather than being under the control of the player. 
                        How players relate to these companions (both in conversations and elsewhere) can open up quests and affect the game's ending.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Meditation can now be done anywhere, provided there are no enemies nearby to prevent it, but Geralt must now enter meditation mode to drink a potion.

                    On April 7, 2015, CD PROJEKT RED announced two major expansions for The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt, entitled Hearts of Stone and Blood and Wine. 
                    CD PROJEKT RED said that both expansion packs included new enemies, characters, and gear. Players would also be reunited with some "dearly missed"
                     characters from the series. Hearts of Stone was released on October 13, 2015, and Blood and Wine on May 31, 2016, both are available on all three 
                     major platforms. Players can purchase both expansions at once by getting the Expansion Pass, now on sale through several retailers.

                <p>
                    Hearts of Stone is a major expansion that adds over ten hours of additional content. Geralt will adventure into the wilds of No Man's Land 
                    and the nooks and alleys of Oxenfurt, where he will try to complete a contract from the mysterious Man of Glass. Caught in a thick tangle of 
                    deceit, Geralt will need all his cunning and strength to solve the mystery and emerge unscathed.

                <p>
                    Blood and Wine is a major expansion that adds over twenty hours of additional content. A tale that will introduce the all-new in-game region of 
                    Toussaint, Blood and Wine will take Geralt to a land untainted by war, where an atmosphere of carefree indulgence and knightly ritual masks an 
                    ancient and bloody secret.
