            <p>
                As Geralt, embark on your most perilous and personal journey yet as you track down Ciri — your adopted daughter and a living weapon of untold power. 
                This child of prophecy, intertwined with you by the bonds of destiny, is sought after by the most dangerous forces of the Continent thanks to the 
                Elder Blood running through her veins. So it falls to you, the one who mentored, trained, and raised her, to safeguard Ciri’s fate and that of the entire realm.

            <h1>Choices and consequence</h1>
            <p>
                Geralt's mission will require him to make hard choices. Witchers strive to remain neutral, but often find themselves deciding the fate of others. 
                And rarely are these simple choices between good and evil. In this morally gray world, the choices they make can tip the scales of life and death. 
                Wild Hunt features multiple endings that result from choices you make throughout the game. With three extensive epilogues and multiple world 
                end-states in each, the game delivers unmatched replayability.

            <p>
                The world of The Witcher beckons to be explored -- just pick a point on the horizon and venture off into the unknown. You'll have your trusty horse 
                to call on whenever you need. Load it with trophies taken from the massive beasts you hunt down or gallop it into combat to crush those standing 
                in your way. You'll also go where no horse can follow, descending deep into sprawling caves, diving beneath the waves to gather sea herbs and search 
                orgotten shipwrecks for long-lost treasure. You'll sail your boat through storms, navigate past hostile sea monsters and along craggy, dangerous shores 
                pounded by waves. This land is rich in mystery and adventure -- traverse it any way you like.

            <h1>Monster hunts</h1>
            <p>
                Geralt is a bounty hunter, an apex predator in a world gone wrong. In a monster-infested world he is a necessary counter-balance. His main task is to 
                eliminate creatures that pose a threat to society. Hunting monsters is his business -- and there's always plenty of work. Monsters come in all shapes 
                and sizes, and while some are members of broader species, others are one -of-a-kind. To face the latter, extremely powerful or clever creatures, 
                you'll embark on special quests to learn about their fighting style and behavior. The monster threat is real and strong. Along your path you'll 
                encounter entire areas overrun by beasts, the humans and nonhumans who once lived there gone. Should you decide to risk death, your job will be 
                to exterminate every last pest and render these places safe once more. Succeed and you'll see folk return, more than eager to craft and sell you rare, 
                enhanced gear.
