                <h1>The Witcher</h1>
                <p>
                    The Witcher (Polish: Wiedźmin) is a role-playing video game for the PC, developed by CD PROJEKT RED and 
                    published by Atari. Based on The Witcher series of the same name by Polish author Andrzej Sapkowski, the 
                    game utilizes BioWare's proprietary Aurora Engine and was released in October 2007.
                    In the first 10 months following its release, the game sold 800,000 copies worldwide. A console version using 
                    an entirely new engine and combat system, titled The Witcher: Rise of the White Wolf, was planned for release in 
                    Fall 2009, but development was suspended indefinitely on May 6, 2009.
                </p>
                    The Witcher follows the story of Geralt of Rivia, a witcher: a traveling monster hunter for hire, gifted with 
                    unnatural powers. Taking place in a fictional medieval world, the game implements detailed visuals. The natural 
                    light during various phases of the day is realistically altered, and the day and night transitions serve to enrich 
                    the game's ambiance. The weather can dynamically change from a light drizzle to a dark, stormy downpour accompanied 
                    by thunder and lightning, and the NPCs react to the rain by hiding under roofs trying to get out of the rain.

                <h2>Story</h2>
                <hr>
                <p>
                    The game is centred on Geralt the witcher, also known as "the White Wolf", who at the beginning of the game 
                    suffers from amnesia. He gradually learns that he was a very renowned witcher, and that he had friends and 
                    enemies almost everywhere, who remember him but whom he does not remember. Through the player's actions, he will 
                    redefine those relationships and choose his path in the political intrigue that surrounds him.
                </p>

                <h3 id="motivation">Story Motivations</h3>
                <p>
                    The developers have often said that their main goal with the game's storyline was to give choices to the player 
                    where there was no clear good or evil, and where the player would have to choose the lesser of two (or more) evils.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Also, the story was designed so that the consequences of the player's choices are often not immediately visible, 
                    and may only become apparent a few chapters later. This was done to prevent the "save, choose, reload" type of 
                    gameplay that is often used in similar computer role-playing games.
                </p>

                <h3 id="inconsistencies">Inconsistencies with Andrzej Sapkowski's Works</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        According to the "Temerian Dynasty", additional material written by Andrzej Sapkowski and published on his 
                        official website, Adda the White, the daughter of Foltest, after her striga curse was lifted by Geralt, was 
                        white-haired and intellectually disabled. However, in the English translation of the short story "The Witcher", 
                        Adda's hair is described as "flaxen red", and her hair is also shown as red in the game. There is also no 
                        explanation for the change of her mental state.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        In the game's intro, the date given is 1270, but according to the book it should be set in 1273 
                        (five years after the end of Northern War II, which ended in 1268 and during the second Catriona outbreak, 
                        which started in 1272).
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The inclusion of the books Fairy Tales and Stories and Encyclopaedia Maxima Mundi is an anachronism, since 
                        these books were written hundreds of years after the times depicted in the game.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Geralt calls himself "not a human, but a mutant" on some occasions. On the other hand, Geralt never claimed 
                        he wasn't a human in the saga (at the very most, stating, "Not quite [a human]" in A Grain of Truth), and 
                        being a witcher was typically referenced as more than a caste or a profession than anything else - mutation 
                        does not imply no longer being a human.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        In the Enhanced Edition, the Bonus DVD contains an interview that reveals that Andrzej Sapowski himself had 
                        built a relationship with the development team and revealed to them that Geralt did survive the events 
                        depicted in the end of the series of books. Despite this, the events depicted in all the games remain non-canon.
                    </li>

                <h2>Gameplay</h2>
                <hr>
                <p>
                    There are three camera styles available when playing The Witcher. The game can be played from 
                    one of two top-down perspectives, in which case the mouse is used to control everything, or it can be 
                    played from an over-the-shoulder (OTS) view, which brings the player closer to the in-game combat, but 
                    limits visibility. In all three views the keyboard and mouse controls can be changed to be primarily mouse 
                    focused, or a combined keyboard-and-mouse approach.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The combat system in The Witcher represents a departure from most RPGs. Players choose one of three fighting 
                    styles. The quick style allows for faster, less-damaging attacks with a greater chance of hitting faster enemies; 
                    the heavy style deals more damage in exchange for a slow attack speed, and a lower chance to hit faster enemies; 
                    and the group style, which features sweeping attacks best used if the player is surrounded. The player can switch 
                    between the styles at any point.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Each of these stances has its own unique combat style. Both of Geralt's main swords, steel and silver, have distinctively 
                    different combat styles from the rest of his weaponry, and serve very distinct purposes: where the steel blade is used to 
                    fight humans and other flesh-and-blood beings, the silver is more effective against supernatural monsters and beasts 
                    (some of which may be completely unaffected by steel).
                </p>
                <p>
                    Alchemy is a major part of gameplay. The player can create potions that increase health or endurance regeneration, 
                    allow Geralt to see in the dark, or provide other beneficial effects. The recipes for these potions can be learned 
                    through scrolls, or by experimentation. Once the player creates an unknown potion he can choose to drink it, but if 
                    the potion is a failure it will poison the character. Each time Geralt drinks potions they increase the toxicity level of his body. 
                    This can be reduced by drinking a special potion or by meditating at an inn or fireplace.
